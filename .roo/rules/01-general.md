# General rules

1. The backend is FastAPI-based
2. Always assume packages are already installed
3. The planning/TODO of the task should be as detail as possible to increase project understand.
4. Do not include any testing/verifying step in TODO.
5. Always speak in Vietnamese (but keep concepts/terminologies in English)
